### First Run (all records)

When you first install this package, your records won't have the Namsor Gender info available just yet, you will need to run the script once for all your database before you start.

To do this, the are some simple steps:

1) Open the Developer Console:

2) Click on `Execute Anonymous`:

3) Run the following script:

```java
NamSor_BatchExecution batchExecution = new NamSor_BatchExecution(true);
Database.executeBatch(batchExecution, 100);
```

## How does this Addon work?

This Addon will run a Schedule Job (created on the installation step above) every day at the specified time.

Steps performed:
- Get all the Contacts created on the last 2 days;
- Verify which ones do not have Namsor's Likely Gender information yet;
- Separate the records in batches of 100 records each;
- Call the Namsor API for all the retrieved records;
- Update the Contacts with the retrieved Namsor gander information.
